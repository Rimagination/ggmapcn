Dear CRAN team,

This is a minor version update for `ggmapcn` (from v0.1.2 to v0.2.0).

This update introduces two major new features for map annotation:

1.  **`annotation_compass()`**: For adding a highly customizable compass/north arrow.
2.  **`annotation_scalebar()`**: For adding a projection-aware and intelligent scale bar.

These new functions offer significantly more flexibility and styling options than the previous implementation.

All new functions are fully documented with examples.

Thank you for your consideration.
